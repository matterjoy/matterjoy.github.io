            <p class = "aboutme">Hi there, I’m Mattie Kim. I stand for many things, but am drawn to sustainability, financial literacy, and culture. This often leads me toward connecting with others and seeking perspective with an open mind.<br> I strive to be kind, wise, and reckless. I prioritize staying organized, making time for others, and investing in myself. But, most importantly, I’m looking forward to leading a life with purpose.<br> In my free free time, I enjoy reading and watching stand up comedy to make up for the fact that I am not the best writer and am definitely not funny.. <br>Currently, I am a student at Georiga Tech majoring in Computational Media and minoring in Sustainable Cities. I am from Los Angeles and am hoping to live in other places to help expose myself to new people, different lifestyles, and fresh perspectives.<br>Wishing you wonder,<br>Mattie.</p>
